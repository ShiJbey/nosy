# Nosy: Neighborly Story Sifting Language

Nosy is a query language based on Datalog that is
specifically designed for story sifting Neighborly
worlds. It integrates with Neighborly's entity-component
system, and enables users to look for specific
relations/patterns in the data. The syntax is borrowed
from Datomic and DataScript.

Nosy does not support all the features that Datomic has.
